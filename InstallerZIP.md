# Introduction #

This guide will eventually walk you through building a ZIP with a SplashKit-powered HTML/JavaScript application.

At this stage it zips down to about 11 MB. That's OK for a downloadable installer for say SQL Server, perhaps not so nice for a simple app :(

Most of it is icudt40.dll :(
